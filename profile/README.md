## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

The Elven Tools includes the Smart Contract, CLI tool, and minter dapp for NFT launches. Every part of it can be used as a separate tool. But the best is to use it all together. You can, of course, use the Smart Contract separately, for example, with [mxpy](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/sdk-py/mxpy-cli/), but the elven-tools cli gives you a lot of simplification with the process. You don't have to think about proper arguments because it will ask you for them. Then you can deploy the Minter Dapp to start selling.
